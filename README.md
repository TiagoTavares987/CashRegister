# Final Project for the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering

We proposed the development of a cross-platform software for a cash register with the capability to send receipts via email, print invoices, barcode scanning, and open the cash drawer. Additionally, we will create a web dashboard for visualizing statistics.

# The software features the following functionalities:

  • User login.
  • Encryption of user passwords (MD5, Base64).

   Admin can add new clients, employees (admin or non-admin), products, and product families.
  • Possibility to send invoices via email in PDF format (SMTP).
  • Generate duplicate copies of invoices.
